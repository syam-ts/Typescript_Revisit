lib: --> Add dom and dom.iterable (note: lowercase) to the list of libraries to allow all the browser APIs if you're writing front-end code.
strict: --> If true, enables all strict type checking options. I strongly recommend it for new projects. You might need to turn it off if you're migrating an existing JS project.
skipLibCheck: --> If true, skips type checking of all declaration files (which means it won't try to type check your infinitely large node_modules folder). Drastically speeds up compilation time.
verbatimModuleSyntax: --> If true, simplifies some weirdness with importing and exporting types, basically it forces you to import and export types using the import type syntax. I recommend it.
esModuleInterop: --> If true, allows you to use import syntax with CommonJS modules. Very useful if you need to work with CommonJS (Node) code.
moduleDetection: --> If set to force, will consider everything to be a module, which is what you want in any new project.
noUncheckedIndexedAccess: --> If true, adds undefined to the type of any indexed access, which can prevent some runtime errors. I recommend it.
